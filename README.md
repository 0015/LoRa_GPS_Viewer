# Map Viewer for MCU with LoRa & GPS Data

* [ThatProject Channel](https://youtube.com/ThatProject) 

LoRa module has caught the attention of many people for a number of reasons. Being able to send data to a device that is far away is very interesting. This viewer I made is to display the GPS data sent to the LoRa module on a map. If you pass the data according to the JSON format I predefined, you can display the GPS data on the map without any problems.

You can try it right away from here (But need to prepare MCU with LoRa and GPS module).
